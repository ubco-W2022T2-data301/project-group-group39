## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The three of us all have interest in the sport of basketball, from a dedicated fan to a intrigued new comer. We hope to gain a better insight into the current nba as well as its evolution over the years in terms of player performance. We want to compare the players who have put up consistent stats throughout their careers and which players did not perform consistently and were replaced. The players who outperformed their own past performance and during what time they were in their prime. We are also interested in the turnovers as well as 3 Point Field Goals Attempted as the NBA has shifted to 3-point shooting as time has moved on. Additionally, looking at players efficiencies of players over the course of the nba, specifically it's overall Fg% and ft%. we are also curious to see if any players are on track to break any NBA all-time records. We could imagine building a user facing dashboard with informative and captivating information and graphs as we know many others share an interest in this topic.
